# Account Balance Masker
A chrome extension which enables masking of account balances when visiting certain financial websites. This extension is to help give you a little more privacy when doing your everyday banking in a browser. 

## Features

- Masks the account balances upon loading the webpage of the supported financial banking websites (is shown as "****"). 
- Unmasks the account balance by simply hovering over masked balance so you can see the original value.
- No external tracking of the masked values. Everything remains within the browser.
